# 4.7.0
- new argument 'excludeVars' in createSdcObj()
- sdcGUI() opens shiny-app automatically
- shiny-version of the GUI directly included in the package
- save pram-parameters in slot '@pram' for each pramed-variable
- new helper function `addWarnings()` which adds warnings also to slot `@additionalResults$sdcMicro_warnings`. This is required so that we can access warnings easier within shiny and use `tryCatch()` in a managable way.
- new method 'addGhostVars()' that allows to specify ghostVars easier within the GUI.
- remove parameter 'opt' in microaggregation
- removed matrix-method for microaggregation()
- removed argument 'strata_variables() for sdcMicroObj-method of microaggregation()
- new method "strataVar<-" that allows temporarily resetting strata variable in an sdcMicroObj-object
